# Simple_Linear_Regression
Used LinearRegression class from sklearn to create correlation between Depedent variable and Independent variable using Training Set.
This learnt model being used to predict values of Test set.
Used matplotlib.pyplot library to visualise Training and Test set.

Here in 'Salary_Data.csv' (dataset) first coloum contain the number of year experience and second coloum contain salary of employe.
Dataset broken into Trainig set and Test set, size of Training set is 2/3 of Dataset and size of Test set is 1/3 of Dataset.
So based on Training Data, Linear Regression model will create a straight line, which will be best fit to observation points and having low cost value(minimum error), learnt Linear Regression model will used for predicting Salary of remaining employe (Test set).

Note: Cost computation can be derived from RMS (Root Mean Square).
